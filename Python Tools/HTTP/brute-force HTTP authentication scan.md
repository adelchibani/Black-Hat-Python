This Python script is designed to perform a **brute-force HTTP authentication scan** on a target web server to attempt login using a list of usernames and passwords. It tries both basic authentication and can also route through a proxy.

### Key Components:

1. **Imports**:
   - The script imports several Python libraries, such as `socket`, `urllib2`, `httplib`, `base64`, and `sys` to handle network connections, HTTP requests, base64 encoding for authentication headers, and error handling.

2. **Class: `HTTPScan`**:
   - **Methods**:
     - `basic_auth`: This method performs basic HTTP authentication by encoding the username and password into a base64 token and attaching it to the `Authorization` header. It attempts to make a request to the target HTTP server using `urllib2`.
     - `basic_auth2`: Similar to the `basic_auth` method but uses `httplib` to handle the request instead of `urllib2`.
     - `basic_auth_proxy`: This method performs basic authentication while using a proxy server. It creates a proxy handler and uses it to send the authentication request.
     - `startHTTPScanBruteForce`: This is the main method to perform the brute-force scan. It checks if port 80 (HTTP) is open on the target IP, then tries the authentication for each user-password combination from `users.txt` and `passwords.txt`.

3. **Brute-force Scanning**:
   - The script opens the `users.txt` and `passwords.txt` files, which are expected to contain a list of usernames and passwords to try. The username-password pairs are used to attempt basic authentication on the target server.
   - If the server responds successfully (valid credentials), the script logs the valid pair; if invalid, it prints an incorrect login message.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - The script has a basic error handling mechanism that catches exceptions such as network errors, HTTP errors, and file errors, printing relevant error messages.

### Code Flow:

1. **Port Check**:
   - The script first checks if port 80 (HTTP) on the target IP address is open using a socket connection (`sock.connect_ex((ip, 80))`).

2. **Authentication Attempts**:
   - If port 80 is open, it opens the `users.txt` and `passwords.txt` files, iterating through each username and password combination to try to authenticate with the target server using the methods defined earlier (`basic_auth`, `basic_auth2`, `basic_auth_proxy`).
   
3. **Proxy Support**:
   - If a proxy server address is provided, the script will route the HTTP requests through the proxy by using the `basic_auth_proxy` method.

4. **Handling Authentication Results**:
   - For each username-password combination, if the login is successful, the script prints that the user and password were found. If the login is incorrect, it prints a failure message.

5. **File Closing**:
   - The script ensures that the `users.txt` and `passwords.txt` files are closed after the scanning process completes.

### Potential Vulnerabilities Addressed:

- **Basic Authentication**:
  - The script targets servers that use basic HTTP authentication. It can help detect weak passwords by brute-forcing common username and password combinations.
  
- **Proxy Usage**:
  - It supports routing through a proxy, which could help anonymize the attack or bypass some network restrictions.

### Considerations:

- **Usage**:
  - This script can be used in penetration testing or security auditing to check the strength of HTTP basic authentication on a target system. It is important to have authorization from the target system owner before performing any testing, as unauthorized brute-forcing or scanning is illegal in many jurisdictions.
  
- **File Requirements**:
  - The script expects the `users.txt` and `passwords.txt` files to be present. These files should contain lists of usernames and passwords, respectively.
  
- **Error Handling**:
  - The script prints error messages to the console when it encounters issues with connections or files.
  
- **Threading / Parallelization**:
  - This brute-force approach is sequential. For faster scanning, you might want to consider adding threading or other parallelization techniques.

### Example Output:
```
Port 80 open

[*] Started scanning 'http://example.com' 

Found admin:admin
Found admin:1234
Found user:password
...
```

### Ethical Considerations:

- **Authorization**: Before running the script on any network or web server, ensure that you have explicit permission to perform penetration testing or vulnerability scanning. Unauthorized access is illegal and unethical.
