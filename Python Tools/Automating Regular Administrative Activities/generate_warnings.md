```python
# Demonstrating Warning Handling in Python

import warnings

# Configure warnings to raise an exception instead of just printing
warnings.simplefilter('error', UserWarning)

print('Before')  # This line will execute

# Generate a UserWarning. Because we've set the filter to 'error',
# this will raise an exception and halt execution.
warnings.warn('Write your warning message here')

print('After')  # This line will NOT execute because of the raised exception
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Import `warnings`:** This line imports the `warnings` module, which provides tools for handling warnings.

2. **`warnings.simplefilter('error', UserWarning)`:** This is the crucial part.  `warnings.simplefilter()` is used to control how warnings are handled.  
   - `'error'` means that any warning matching the specified category will be treated as an exception, interrupting the program's flow.
   - `UserWarning` specifies that this rule applies only to warnings of the `UserWarning` category.  This is a standard category for warnings that you, the programmer, generate.  There are other warning categories as well.

3. **`print('Before')`:** This line will execute and print "Before" to the console.

4. **`warnings.warn('Write your warning message here')`:** This line generates a `UserWarning` with the message "Write your warning message here". Because of the `simplefilter` setting, this warning is *not* just printed; it's raised as an exception.

5. **`print('After')`:** This line will *not* execute. Because the `warnings.warn()` call raised an exception, the program terminates at that point.  The exception will be printed to the console, indicating the warning message and the location in the code where it occurred.

**How to Run:**

1. **Save the code:** Save the code above as a Python file (e.g., `warning_example.py`).

2. **Run from the command line:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run it using the command:

   ```bash
   python warning_example.py
   ```

   You will see the "Before" output, followed by the traceback of the exception caused by the warning.  The "After" output will not appear.

**Key takeaway:** By setting the warning filter to 'error', you can force your code to stop when a specific type of warning occurs. This can be very useful for debugging and ensuring that you address potential issues that your code might be flagging.  If you want to handle warnings differently (e.g., just log them, ignore them, or convert them to exceptions only under certain conditions), you can explore the other options available with `warnings.simplefilter()` and `warnings.filterwarnings()`.
