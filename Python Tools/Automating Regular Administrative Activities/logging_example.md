This script demonstrates how to use Python's `logging` module to write log messages to a file and then read and display the log file's contents.

---

### **Breakdown of the Code**
```python
import logging  # Import the logging module
```
- The `logging` module is used to log messages to a file instead of printing them to the console.

---

### **Configuring Logging**
```python
LOG_FILENAME = 'hello.py'  # Define the log file name

# Configure logging to write to the specified file
logging.basicConfig(
    filename=LOG_FILENAME,  # Log messages will be saved in 'hello.py'
    level=logging.DEBUG,    # Log messages of level DEBUG and higher
)
```
- **`logging.basicConfig()`** → Configures logging settings:
  - `filename=LOG_FILENAME` → Writes logs to `hello.py`.
  - `level=logging.DEBUG` → Logs messages of **DEBUG** level and above.

---

### **Writing a Log Message**
```python
logging.debug('This message should go to the log file')
```
- This logs a **DEBUG** level message in the `hello.py` file.

---

### **Reading and Displaying the Log File**
```python
with open(LOG_FILENAME, 'rt') as f:  # Open the log file in read mode
    prg = f.read()  # Read its contents

print('FILE:')
print(prg)  # Display the file contents
```
- **Opens** `hello.py` in **read mode (`rt`)**.
- **Reads** the entire file into `prg`.
- **Prints** the file contents to the console.

---

### **Expected Behavior**
- The script **writes a log message** to `hello.py` and **immediately reads and prints** its contents.

---

### **Potential Issue**
- The log file is named **`hello.py`**, which **overwrites an existing Python script** named `hello.py`.
- **Fix**: Change the log file to `hello.log` to avoid conflicts.

---

### **Improved Version**
```python
import logging

LOG_FILENAME = 'hello.log'  # Use .log to avoid overwriting Python files

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(filename=LOG_FILENAME, level=logging.DEBUG)

# Write a log message
logging.debug('This message should go to the log file')

# Read and print the log file contents
with open(LOG_FILENAME, 'rt') as f:
    prg = f.read()

print('FILE CONTENTS:')
print(prg)
```

---

### **How to Run the Script**
1. **Save the script** as `log_example.py`.
2. **Run it**:
   ```sh
   python log_example.py
   ```
3. **Check the log file**:
   ```sh
   cat hello.log   # Linux/macOS
   type hello.log  # Windows
   ```
   Expected content:
   ```
   DEBUG:root:This message should go to the log file
   ```

---

### **Key Takeaways**
✅ **Avoid naming logs as `.py` files** (prevents overwriting Python scripts).  
✅ **Use `.log` or `.txt` for logs**.  
✅ **`logging.debug()` writes logs** → **Ensure the logging level includes `DEBUG`**.  
✅ **Always read logs safely**.
