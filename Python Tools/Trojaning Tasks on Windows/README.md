**When you deploy a trojan, you want to perform a few
common tasks: grab keystrokes, take screenshots, and
execute shellcode to provide an interactive session to
tools like CANVAS or Metasploit. We’ll wrap things up with some sandbox detection techniques to determine if we are running within an antivirus or forensics sandbox. These
modules will be easy to modify and will work within our trojan framework.
We’ll explore man-in-the-browser-style attacks and privilege escalation techniques that you can deploy with your trojan. Each technique comes with its own challenges and probability of being caught by the
end user or an antivirus solution.**
